## WELCOME TO COMP 1510!

### WHAT IS THIS?
As we examine Python we will review code in this repo.

### HOW SHOULD YOU USE THIS?
1. During each lecture I will pull examples from this code.
2. After each lecture, I will assign additional reading homework from this repo
3. By the end of the term, you will have studied every file in this repo.

### HOW SHOULD YOU STUDY A PYTHON FILE?
1. Read the docstring at the top of the file
2. Execute the program
3. Compare the program output with the code in the main function
4. Examine the file and its contents line by line top to bottom
5. When you examine something, don't just skim it:
    1. Describe what it does out loud, line by line (use the language of computing!)
    2. Name the functions, local variables, as they enter scope
    3. In each function identify arguments and return types, control structures, the types and helper functions being used
    4. Identify the goal of each program, function, and code snippet
    5. Try to represent the code with a flowchart
6. Modify the code in main, and predict what will happen BEFORE you execute it
7. Were you right?

### WHAT ELSE SHOULD YOU KNOW?
This is a living collection. I will update it from time to time and let you know.


Good luck, and have fun!
